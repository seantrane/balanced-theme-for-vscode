## VS Code Extension Quickstart <a id="vsce-quickstart"></a>

### What's in the folder

- This folder contains all of the files necessary for your extension
- `package.json` - this is the manifest file that defines the location of the theme file and specifies the base theme of the theme
- `themes/BalanceD.tmTheme` - the color theme definition file

### Get up and running straight away

- press `F5` to open a new window with your extension loaded
- open `File > Preferences > Color Themes` and pick your color theme

### Make changes

- you can relaunch the extension from the debug toolbar after making changes to the files listed above
- you can also reload (`Ctrl+R` or `Cmd+R` on Mac) the VS Code window with your extension to load your changes

### Install your extension

- To start using your extension with Visual Studio Code copy it into the `<user home>/.vscode/extensions` folder and restart Code.
- To share your extension with the world, read on <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs> about publishing an extension.
